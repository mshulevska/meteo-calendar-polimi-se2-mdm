The X software house wants to offer a new weather based online calendar for helping people
scheduling their personal events avoiding bad weather conditions in case of outdoor activities. Users, once registered, should be able to create, delete and update events. An event should contain information about when and where the event will take place, whether the event will be indoor or outdoor. During event creation, any number of registered users can be invited. Only the organizer will be able to update or delete the event. Invited users can only accept or decline the invitation. Whenever an event is saved, the system should enrich the event with weather forecast information (if available). Moreover, it should notify all event participants one day before the event in case of bad weather conditions for outdoor events. Notifications are received by the users when they log into the system.
